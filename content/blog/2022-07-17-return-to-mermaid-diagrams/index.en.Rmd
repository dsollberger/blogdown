I have been meaning to get back into making flow charts for a while.  Over the years, I have tried different code packages, but I think that `mermaid` graphs make the most sense for my simple goals.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("DiagrammeR")
```

For today's practice, let us try to make a 2-by-2 decision tree.

```{r}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("
  graph LR
  node1(start)
  node2{A}
  node3{not A}
  node4[B given A]
  node5[not B given A]
  node6[B given not A]
  node7[not B given not A]
  
  node1 --> node2
  node1 --> node3
  node2 --> node4
  node2 --> node5
  node3 --> node6
  node3 --> node7
")
```
