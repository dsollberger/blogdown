Today I finally got around to trying to make another `blogdown` site.  In the web searches, I found that I was not alone in having trouble using the `academic` theme, so I switched over to [universal](https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme).  I still wanted a complex theme where I could customize colors and widgets.
