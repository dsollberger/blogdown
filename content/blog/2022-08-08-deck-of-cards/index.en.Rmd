Years ago, I had to simulate a deck of playing cards in a Python course.  Oddly enough, I don't recall ever carrying out this task in R.  Today, I saw a neat code snippet about the `crossing()` command in `tidyr` by Tan Ho in the `R4DS` Slack channel, so let us give it a try.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
```


```{r}
suit <- c("D", "H", "C", "S")
rank <- c(2:10, "J", "Q", "K", "A")
deck <- tidyr::crossing(rank, suit) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(card = paste0(rank, suit))
```

This yields a data frame with 3 columns: `rank`, `suit`, `card`.

```{r}
deck |> as_tibble() |> print(n = Inf)
```
