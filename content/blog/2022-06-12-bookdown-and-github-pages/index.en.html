<p>Today I finally got a <code>bookdown</code> book to appear properly in GitHub pages (well, perhaps I did this in the past, but I do not recall).</p>
<p>The main gap was that I needed to add the following line</p>
<pre><code>output_dir: docs</code></pre>
<p>to the <code>_bookdown.yml</code> file. Of course, the GitHub repository and Pages needed to be set up as well to point to the <code>docs</code> subdirectory.</p>
<p>Here were the helpful websites</p>
