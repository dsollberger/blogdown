Today I finally got a `bookdown` book to appear properly in GitHub pages (well, perhaps I did this in the past, but I do not recall).

The main gap was that I needed to add the following line

```
output_dir: docs
```

to the `_bookdown.yml` file.  Of course, the GitHub repository and Pages needed to be set up as well to point to the `docs` subdirectory.
