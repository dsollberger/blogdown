<p>Today I finally got around to trying to make another <code>blogdown</code> site. In the web searches, I found that I was not alone in having trouble using the <code>academic</code> theme, so I switched over to <a href="https://github.com/devcows/hugo-universal-theme">universal</a>. I still wanted a complex theme where I could customize colors and widgets.</p>
