<p>Today I wanted to try out the <code>flashr</code> package for making flash cards (i.e.Â see if this is something I want to pursue further).</p>
<p>Someone (I am assuming his name is Jeffrey Stevens) over in the R4DS Slack channel mentioned a <a href="https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/flashr/">blog post</a> using the <code>flashr</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#devtools::install_github(&quot;JeffreyRStevens/flashr&quot;)
library(flashr)</code></pre>
<p>From one of my <code>30 Day Map Challenge</code> adventures, I had a data frame about availability of therapy in the United States. Today, I am going to make myself a quiz on states and their abbreviations.</p>
